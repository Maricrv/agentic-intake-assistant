# Generic Agentic Intake Assistant

This project explores the design and implementation of a reusable, domain-agnostic agentic intake layer for service-based processes.

The focus is on:
- structured conversational intake
- readiness evaluation
- system-agnostic handoff
- explainable agentic behavior

This repository contains product, business, and system design documentation, followed by a technical implementation.
